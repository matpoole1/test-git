## The Birds and The Bees

This is a metaphorical phrase that refers to the explanation of reproduction and sexual intercourse, typically given to children. The phrase is often used as a euphemism for the biological facts of life.

### About Birds
Birds are warm-blooded, feathered vertebrates with beaks, wings, and the ability to lay eggs. They are known for their beautiful songs and ability to fly (though not all birds can fly).

### About Bees
Bees are flying insects known for their role in pollination and producing honey. They live in highly organized colonies and are essential for the pollination of many plants and crops.

### The Connection
The phrase "the birds and the bees" likely comes from the way both creatures are involved in plant reproduction through pollination, which can serve as a gentle introduction to the topic of reproduction in general.
